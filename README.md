# Anthropic Test (2025-07-28)

Ths is a test program using the Anthropic API, as well as their Golang package:  
https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go

-----

To run, you need to set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment-variable.
For example:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="abc123" ./anthropic-test-20250728
```

Where `abc123` is replaced with whatever your Anthropic API-key actually is.
